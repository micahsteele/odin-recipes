        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Celery Apple salad is a refreshing dish that packs loads of flavor. Beyond the two
            ingredients in the title it also contains a nice punch of acidity and healthy dose
            of umami flavor. Once you have mastered this recipe I recommend tweaking the type of
            acid that you add to the dish as well as the umami flavoring agent, in this case that
            agent happens to be mustard and garlic.
